## Synopsis
The Bar Builder is an application that allows users to view cocktail recipes in a variety of ways.  In addition to browsing via three filters and search functionality, users can select ingredients that they own (Inventory) to see what drinks they can make with what they have (Bar Menu).  The application fetches recipes from The Cocktail DB API.  Future iterations will include the ability to create an account in order to persist the user's inventory and bar menu.
